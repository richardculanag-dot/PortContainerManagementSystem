Port Container Management System
This program simulates a Port Container Management System where containers are stored in a stack (LIFO) and ships are queued for loading (FIFO). Users can store containers, register ships, view containers and ships, and load the next ship by transferring the top container from the stack to the front ship in the queue. It implements a menu-driven interface to manage the operations of the port.
